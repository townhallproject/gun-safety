    <h1>Stand Up for Safer Gun Laws</h1>
    <p>Nine people are dead and 26 people were injured after a mass shooting in Dayton, Ohio.
        The incident took place within 13 hours of the shooting in El Paso, Texas where at least 20 people were killed and 26 more wounded.
        On top of that Chicago&#39;s Mount Sinai Hospital temporarily stopped accepting patients Sunday morning because they were at capacity following a series of shootings.
      <strong> This is not normal. </strong>
        The Gun Violence Prevention community is calling on Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump to cancel August recess and finally take action to address this horrific national public safety threat.
